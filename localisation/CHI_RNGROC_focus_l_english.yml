CHI_anewdisarmamentagreement_desc:0 "After the defeat of the last conventionally operating National Revolutionary Army units in 1947, Japan imposed upon us strict terms to keep us from fielding an army capable to oppose them. The treaties stipulate among other things that 'all deployment of divisions is to be approved by the Imperial Army Headquarters in Tokyo'. Although the regulations have been informally relaxed due to the IJA's demand for auxiliary forces, some divisions have been stuck in bureaucratic limbo, like the '1st Motorized Infantry Division "Wang Jingwei"', proposed in 1958 and still neither apporoved nor denied. We will propose a new, more streamlined, and more favourable treaty. This should help both the IJA and us."

CHI_secretmeetingwithzaibatsuofficials_desc:0 "Through Niwa's contacts, we have managed to arrange a meeting with officials of the Mitsui Zaibatsu. If we agree to let them access our internal markets, they'll surely 'overlook' the Imperial Sanction against exporting weapons to China."

CHI_discoverlostjapaneseheavyequipment_desc:0 "We've stumbled upon a cache of heavy Japanese equipment, even including tanks.
