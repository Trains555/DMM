Although the regulations have been informally relaxed due to the IJA's demand for auxiliary forces, some divisions have been stuck in bureaucratic limbo, like the '1st Motorized Infantry Division "Wang Jingwei"', proposed in 1972 and still neither apporoved nor denied.

CHI_secretmeetingwithzaibatsuofficials_desc:0 "Through Niwa's contacts, we have managed to arrange a meeting with officials of the Mitsui Zaibatsu. If we agree to let them access our internal markets, they'll surely 'overlook' the Imperial Sanction against exporting weapons to China."

CHI_discoverlostjapaneseheavyequipment_desc:0 "We've stumbled upon a cache of heavy Japanese equipment, even including tanks.
